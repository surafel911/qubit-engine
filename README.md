# Qubit-Engine

A game engine I am developing. Challenging myself to
not use any game-development libraries such as
SDL, GLFW, SFML, etc. There are exceptions since tasks
like getting OpenGL/Vulkan function pointers, loading image
formats, and such are too cumbersome and existing code is better
that what I could ever have the patience to write (maybe one day).
Code that isn't mine is marked as such and credit is given to
the author. Apart from that, most of the code in this engine
is my own handywork.

Probably why it won't compile.
